Individual Project COMP-3125

Isabella Crowe


Abstractâ€”This paper analyzes the intersection between urban
crime and student housing in Boston, Massachusetts. The study
employs a data-driven approach, utilizing a publicly available
dataset from Kaggle containing crime reports in Boston from
2017 to 2022. This paper thoroughly examines East Boston,
Dorchester, Roxbury, and Charlestown while highlighting the
Fenway districts. Crime trends were analyzed using visualizations
such as pie charts and bar graphs, highlighting both the most
common types of offenses and their geographic concentrations.
Further, a spatial analysis was conducted using geographic
bounding and interactive mapping with Python libraries, reveal-
ing a significant concentration of incidents in specific neighbor-
hoods and streets. Results indicate that offenses such as larceny,
vandalism, and motor vehicle accidents are most prevalent, with
crime disproportionately concentrated in specific neighborhoods.
The study highlights the trade-offs students face between af-
fordability and safety when searching for off-campus housing in
Boston, Massachusetts.
